Napier Marten held me captive at Oakleigh Farm, Dinton, SP35EY in a shipping container with no water, electric, power, heat, food or toilet. I had a gastric bleed outside in his orchard (documented by Paramedics and Fovant doctor surgery) Despite safeguarding by Wiltshire Council, he assaulted me. I ran for my life. I was helped by the good people of Fovant, Teffont Evias and Shrewton.
